## Creatibox
Creatibox is a sandbox VR, cross-platform and multiplayer game, with a scripting language inclued.

It is highly inspired by Garry's Mod and its Wiremod addon.

It is currently in alpha, so some of theses functionalities will be added later
## Trivia
I made this game because I wanted something better for testing 3d things than Tilt Brush, and as I played many hours Garry's Mod (in sandbox mode), I really wanted a VR game like it.
## System
This game is written in Java, using the SGEngine. It also load lua files for entity scripting, and custom files for models/texture loading.

Every missing files in multiplayer will be remotely downloaded, so don't worry if you are missing a file.
